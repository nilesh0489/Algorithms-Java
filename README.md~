===============

Different algorithmic problems in Java

1. Given two sorted arrays each of size n, find the median of the array obtained after merging the 2 arrays. Complexity should be O(log(n))

2. Given a circular sorted list, find the minimum element in the list.
	Eg: int a[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2} Minimum element: 1
